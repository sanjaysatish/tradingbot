## SQ PYPL Pair trading

Basic pair trading strategy between SQ and PYPL over the lifespan of both tickers. This spreadsheet stores the opening and closing price of SQ and PYPL over a 5 yr period as well as the ratio of their prices (SQ/PYPL) at close each day. If the current ratio is greater than the previous 14 day average ratio then the strategy is long SQ, if the current ratio is less than the 14 average it is long PYPL. It then decides to buy a ticker based on the ratio at the previous days close and sells either at market open or close the next day. Historical profits are calculated both for going long on only one ticker as well as a long/short combo.

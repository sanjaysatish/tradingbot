## SQ PYPL Pair trading

The following is an excel file documenting a basic pair trading strategy between SQ and PYPL over the lifespan of both tickers. This spreadsheet stores the opening and closing price of SQ and PYPL since 11/19/15 as well as the ratio of their prices (SQ/PYPL) at close each day. If the current ratio is greater than the previous 14 day average ratio then the strategy is long SQ, if the current ratio is less than the 14 average it is long PYPL. It then decides to buy a ticker based on the ratio at the previous days close and sells either at market open or close the next day. Historical profits are calculated both for a going long on one ticker and going long on one ticker and shorting the other.
